% Counter setups introduction
In this chapter we develop formulas over unary predicate signatures allowing us
to capture discrete objects such as bits, bounded integers, vectors and
permutations.
We employ these tools in the following chapters to obtain reductions and
hardness bounds between the satisfiability problems for different classes of
logics with built-in equivalence symbols.
We call the formulas allowing us to encode an arbitrary bounded discrete
structure of a particular type \emph{setups}.
The constructions have a strong computer science flavor in the sense that the
structures are modelled as sequences of bits with additional constraints and the
formulas are constructible in deterministic polynomial time.
