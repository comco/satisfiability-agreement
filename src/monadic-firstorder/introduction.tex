% Monadic first-order logic introduction
In this chapter we investigate questions about (finite) satisfiability of
first-order sentences featuring unary predicate symbols and builtin equivalence
symbols in refinement.
This chapter closely matches the development in \cref{ch:monadic-twovar}, but
we use Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"{i}ss\'{e} games instead of two-pebble games.
This method is in a sense more suitable for this full first-order setting, since
the question of (finite) satisfiability of the first-order logic even of a
single binary predicate symbol is undecidable.
It is well-known that:
\begin{itemize}
  % TODO: References for monadic and signle equivalence?
  \item The monadic first-order logic $\Lvp\Fo\nonv1$ has the finite model
  property and its (finite) satisfiability problem is $\cNExpTime$-complete
  \item The first-order logic of a single equivalence relation
  $\Lvp\Fo\nonv0\Eea1\noag$ has the finite model property and its (finite)
  satisfiability problem is $\cPSpace$-complete
  \item The first-order logic of two equivalence relations lacks the finite
  model property and both the satisfiability and finite satisfiability problems
  are undecidable.
\end{itemize}
