% Monadic first-order logic introduction

In this chapter we investigate questions about (finite) satisfiability of
first-order sentences featuring unary predicate symbols and builtin equivalence
symbols in refinement.
Our strategy is to extract small substructures of structures and analyse them
using Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"{i}ss\'{e} games.
It is known that:
\begin{itemize}
  % TODO: References for monadic and signle equivalence?
  \item The monadic first-order logic $\Lvp\Fo\nonv1$ has the finite model
  property and its (finite) satisfiability problem is
  $\cNExpTime$-complete~\cite{Lowenheim1915}
  \item The first-order logic of a single equivalence relation
  $\Lvp\Fo\nonv0\Eea1\noag$ has the finite model property and its (finite)
  satisfiability problem is $\cPSpace$-complete~\cite{boerger1997classical}
  \item The first-order logic of two equivalence relations
  $\Lvp\Fo\nonv0\Eea2\noag$ lacks the finite model property and both the
  satisfiability and finite satisfiability problems are
  undecidable~\cite{Janiczak1953}.
\end{itemize}
% TODO: Summary of results
Let $\uUS\szu = \seq{\suu1,\suu2,\dots,\suu\szu}$ be an unary predicate
signature consisting of the unary predicate symbols $\suu\ii$.
Let $\eES\sze = \seq{\see1,\see2,\dots,\see\sze}$ be a binary predicate
signature consisting of the builtin equivalence symbols $\see\jj$ in refinement.
Let $\ueSigS\szu\sze = \uUS\szu + \eES\sze$, so $\ueSigS\szu\sze$ is a generic
predicate signature for the monadic first-order logic
$\Lvp\Fo\nonv1\Eea\sze\agrefine$.
