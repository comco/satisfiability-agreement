In this chapter we investigate questions about satisfiability of the
two-variable first-order logic with counting quantifiers $\vFoc2$
with builtin equivalence symbols in refinement.
The base case $\vFoc2$ and the general case of several unrelated builtin
equivalence symbols have been studied. The following is known:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
  The two-variable logic with counting quantifiers $\vFoc2$ lacks the
  finite model property and both its satisfiability and finite satisfiability
  problems are $\cNExpTime$-complete~\cite{Pratt-Hartmann2005}.
  \item
  The two-variable logic with counting quantifiers with a single builtin
  equivalence symbol $\vFoc2\Eea1\noag$ lacks the finite model property and both
  its satisfiability and finite satisfiability problems are
  $\cNExpTime$-complete~\cite{MALQ:MALQ201400102}.
  \item
  The two-variable logic with counting quantifiers with $\sze\geq2$ builtin
  equivalence symbols $\vFoc2\Eea\sze\noag$ lacks the finite model property and
  both its satisfiability and finite satisfiability problems are
  undecidable~\cite{MALQ:MALQ201400102}.
\end{itemize}
