% Type realizibility of the two-variable first-order logic
Recall from~\Cref{sec:scott-nf} about normal forms that every $\vFo2$-sentence
$\fphi$ can be reduced in polynomial time sentence $\sctr\fphi$ in Scott normal
form:
\[
  \forall\xx\forall\yy (\falpp0(\xx,\yy) \lor \xx = \yy) \land
  \bigwedge_{1 \leq \ii \leq \nm} \forall\xx\exists\yy(
  \falpp\ii(\xx,\yy) \land \xx \neq \yy),
\]
where the formulas $\falpp\ii$ are quantifier-free and use at most linearly many
new unary predicate symbols. We refer to $\falpp0$ as the \emph{universal part},
or the $\forall\forall$-part of the formula $\sctr\fphi$ and to $\falpp\ii$ as
the \emph{existential parts}, or the $\forall\exists$-parts of the formula,
for $\ii \in [1,\nm]$.
For any formula in Scott normal form, we may replace its existential parts
by fresh binary predicate symbols: for $\ii \in [1,\nm]$, let $\smm\ii$ be a
fresh binary predicate symbol with the intended interpretation
$\forall\xx\forall\yy (\xx\neq\yy \limp (\smm\ii(\xx,\yy) \lequ
\falpp\ii(\xx,\yy)))$. Since this is a universal sentence, it can be
incorporated into the $\forall\forall$-part $\falpp0$ of the formula.
We refer to the symbols $\gls{message-symbol-m-i}$ as the \emph{message
symbols}.
Hence the formula can be transformed in polynomial time to the form:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:twovar-msg-nf}
  \forall\xx\forall\yy (\falp(\xx,\yy) \lor \xx = \yy) \land
  \bigwedge_{1 \leq \ii \leq \nm} \forall\xx\exists\yy
  (\smm\ii(\xx,\yy) \land \xx \neq \yy),
\end{equation}
where the $\forall\forall$-part $\falp$ is quantifier-free and over an extended
signature. For convenience, we make the existential part of the formula part of
the signature, so we can focus only on the universal part. The following is a
term similar to the one defined in~\cite{MALQ:MALQ201400102}:
\begin{definition}
A \emph{classified signature} $\gls{classified-signature-S-m}$ for the
two-variable first-order logic $\vFo2$ is a predicate signature $\SigS$ together
with a sequence $\sms = \smm1\smm2\dots\smm\nm$ of distinct binary predicate
symbols from $\SigS$ having intended interpretation
\[
  \bigwedge_{1 \leq \ii \leq \nm} \forall\xx\exists\yy 
  (\smm\ii(\xx,\yy) \land \xx \neq \yy).
\]
\end{definition}
That is, a classified signature \emph{automatically includes} the
$\forall\exists$-part of formulas and $\ClSig\SigS\sms$-structures
automatically satisfy the $\forall\exists$-part.

\begin{definition}
The \emph{(finite) classified satisfiability problem for two-variable
first-order logic} is:
given a classified signature $\ClSig\SigS\sms$ and a quantifier-free
$\vFoF2\SigS$-formula $\falp(\xx,\yy)$, is there a (finite)
$\ClSig\SigS\sms$-structure satisfying~\cref{eq:twovar-msg-nf}.
Denote tha classified satisfiability problem for two-variable first-order logic
by $\ClSat{\vFo2}$ and its finite version by $\FinClSat{\vFo2}$.
\end{definition}

Scott normal form shows that (finite) satisfiability reduces in polynomial time
to (finite) classified satisfiability:
\[
  \FinASat{\vFo2} \red\cP \FinAClSat{\vFo2}.
\]
