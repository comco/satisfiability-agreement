% Two-variable logics introduction
In this chapter we investigate questions about the complexity of satisfiability
and finite satisfiability of the two-variable first-order logic $\vFo2$ with
builtin equivalence symbols in refinement. Recall that for this logic we are
only interested in predicate signatures restricted to only unary and binary
predicate symbols and the formal equality.

The base case for $\vFo2$ and the general case of several \emph{unrelated}
builtin equivalence symbols have been studied. The following is known:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The two-variable first-order logic $\vFo2$ has the finite model
  property~\cite{MALQ:MALQ19750210118} and its (finite) satisfiability problem
  is $\cNExpTime$-complete~\cite{gradel1997decision}.
  \item The two-variable first-order logic with a single builtin equivalence
  symbol $\vFo2\Eea1\noag$ has the finite model property and its (finite)
  satisfiability problem is $\cNExpTime$-complete~\cite{kieronski2005results}.
  \item The two-variable first-order logic with two \emph{unrelated} builtin
  equivalence symbols $\vFo2\Eea2\noag$ lacks the finite model property and both
  its satisfiability and finite satisfiability problems are
  $\ceNExpTime2$-complete~\cite{doi:10.1137/120900095}.
  \item The satisfiability and finite satisfiability problems for
  the two-variable first-order logic with $\sze$ builtin equivalence symbols
  $\vFo2\Eea\sze\noag$ are both undecidable for $\sze \geq
  3$~\cite{kieronski2005small}.
\end{itemize}

In this chapter we prove that the logic $\vFo2\Eea\sze\agrefine$ has the finite
model property and its (finite) satisfiability problem is in $\cNExpTime$ for
every $\sze \geq 0$.
We do this by defining an auxilliary problem --- the \emph{type realizability}
problem --- which is formulated at the level of abstraction of \twotypes/ as
opposed to the level of abstraction of formulas; this proves more flexible for
implementing our approach: we look at the different classes of the coarsest
equivalence symbol in a model, we transform them into instances of the simpler
problem featuring one less equivalence symbols and we include enough additional
information to allow us to reconstruct a big model from the traces of its
galaxies.
