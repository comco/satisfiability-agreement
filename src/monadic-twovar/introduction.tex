% Monadic first-order logic introduction
In this chapter we investigate questions about (finite) satisfiability of
two-variable first-order sentences featuring unary predicate symbols and builtin
equivalence symbols in refinement.
We will employ the game-theoretic characterisations of equivalence of
structures as described in \cref{sec:logic-games}.
For the general case of several builtin equivalence relations without agreement,
it is known that:
\begin{itemize}
  \item the full binary two-variable first-order logic of a single
  builtin equivalence symbol $\Lvp\Fo2\nopow\Eea1\noag$ has the finite model
  property and its (finite) satisfiability problem is 
  $\cNExpTime$-complete~\cite{kieronski2005small} 
  \item the full binary two-variable first-order logic of two
  builtin equivalence symbols $\Lvp\Fo2\nopow\Eea2\noag$ lacks the finite model
  property and its satisfiability and finite satisfiability problems are both
  $\ceNExpTime2$-complete~\cite{kieronski2014two}
  \item both the satisfiability and finite satisfiability problems for
  $\Lvp\Fo2\nopow\Eea\sze\noag$, where $\sze \geq 3$ are
  undecidable~\cite{kieronski2005small}.
\end{itemize}
