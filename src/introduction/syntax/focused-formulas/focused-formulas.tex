% Focused formulas

If $\fphi$ is a formula and $\gxx1, \gxx2, \dots, \gxx\nn \in \VarSymbs$ are
distinct variables, we use the notation $\fphi(\gxx1, \gxx2, \dots,
\gxx\nn)$, a \emph{focused formula}, to
show that we are interested in the free occurrences of the variables $\gxx\ii$
in $\fphi$. If $\fphi(\gxx1, \gxx2, \dots, \gxx\nn)$ is a focused formula and
$\gyy1, \gyy2, \dots, \gyy\nn \in \VarSymbs$, then
$\fphi(\gyy1, \gyy2, \dots, \gyy\nn)$ denotes the formula $\fphi$ where all
free occurrences of $\gxx\ii$ are replaced by $\gyy\ii$.
The notation $\fphi = \fphi(\gxx1, \gxx2, \dots, \gxx\nn)$ means that 
$\fvr\fphi \subseteq \set{\gxx1, \gxx2, \dots, \gxx\nn}$.

We will omit unnecessary brackets in formulas.
