% Signatures

A \emph{predicate signature} 
$\gls{predicate-signature} = \seq{\pp1, \pp2, \dots, \pp\sizes}$ is a finite 
sequence of distinct \emph{predicate symbols} $\gls{predicate-symbol-i}$
together with their \emph{arities} $\gls{arity-i} \in \pNats$.
A predicate signature is \emph{unary} or \emph{monadic} if all of its predicate
symbols have arity $1$.
A predicate signature is \emph{binary} if all of its predicate
symbols have arity $1$ or $2$.
For the purposes of this work we will not be considering constant and function
symbols---constant symbols can be simulated by a fresh unary predicate
symbol having the intended interpretation of being true at a unique element;
presence of function symbols on the other hand leads quite easily to undecidable
satisfiability problems.
By convention $\SymbAlph$, $\VarSymbs$ and $\SigS$ are disjoint.
