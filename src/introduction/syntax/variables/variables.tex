% Variable symbols

The sequence $\gls{variable-symbols} = \seq{\vv1,\vv2,\dots}$ is a countable
sequence of distinct \emph{variable symbols}.
We pay special attention to $\gls{first-var} = \vv1$, $\gls{second-var} = \vv2$
and $\gls{third-var} = \vv3$, the \emph{first}, \emph{second} and \emph{third}
variable symbol, respectively.
