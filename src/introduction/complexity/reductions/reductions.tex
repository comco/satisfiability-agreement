% Reductions

If $\dpA \subseteq \Words\alphO_1$ and $\dpB \subseteq \Words\alphO_2$ are
decision problems, the problem $\dpA$ is \emph{polynomial-time reducible} to
$\dpB$ (written $\gls{A-polyred-B}$) if there is a polynomial-time algorithm
$f : \Words\alphO_1 \to \Words\alphO_2$ such that $\ea \in \dpA$ iff
$f(\ea) \in \dpB$.
Similar reductions where $f$ might be in another complexity class are defined
analogously.
The decision problems $\dpA$ and $\dpB$ are \emph{polynomial-time equivalent}
(written $\gls{A-polyequ-B}$) if $\dpA \red\cP \dpB$ and $\dpB \red\cP \dpA$.

A decision problem is \emph{hard} for a complexity class if any decision problem
of that complexity class is polynomial-time reducible to it. A decision problem
is \emph{complete} for a complexity class if it is hard for that class and
contained in that class.
