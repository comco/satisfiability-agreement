% Logic equivalence

Two $\SigS$-sentences $\fphi$ and $\fpsi$ are \emph{logically equivalent}
(written $\gls{phi-psi-equiv}$) if they have the same models.

Two $\SigS$-structures $\StrA$ and
$\StrB$ are \emph{elementary equivalent} (written
$\gls{elementary-equivalent-A-B}$) if they satisfy the same first-order
sentences (hence also the same first-order sentences with counting quantifiers).
The structures $\StrA$ and $\StrB$ are \emph{$\nr$-rank equivalent} (written
$\gls{r-rank-equivalent-A-B}$) if they satisfy the same $\nr$-rank first-order
sentences.
The structures $\StrA$ and $\StrB$ are \emph{$\nv$-variable equivalent} (written
$\gls{v-variable-equivalent-A-B}$) if they satisfy the same $\nv$-variable
first-order sentences.
The structures $\StrA$ and $\StrB$ are \emph{$\nr$-rank $\nv$-variable
equivalent} (written $\gls{r-rank-v-variable-equivalent-A-B}$) if they satisfy
the same $\nr$-rank $\nv$-variable first-order sentences.
