% Structures

If $\SigS$ is a predicate signature, a \emph{$\SigS$-structure}
$\gls{structure-A}$ consists of a nonempty set $\domA$ (the \emph{domain} of
$\StrA$), together with a relation $\at\StrA\gp \subseteq A^{\ar\gp}$ (the
\emph{interpretation} of $\gp$ at $\StrA$) for every predicate symbol $\gp
\in \SigS$. A structure is \emph{finite} if its domain is finite.
We omit the standard definition of semantic notions.
If $\StrA$ is a structure and $\domB \subseteq \domA$ is a nonempty set of
elements of $\StrA$, the substructure of $\StrA$ induced by $\domB$ is denoted
by $(\StrA \restriction \domB)$.
