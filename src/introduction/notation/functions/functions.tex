% Functions

A \emph{function} is formally just a functional relation. The \emph{identity
function} on $\setA$ is $\gls{identity-A}$.
A \emph{total} function from $\setA$ to $\setB$ is denoted
$\gls{total-function-f-A-B}$.
A \emph{injective} function from $\setA$ into $\setB$ is denoted
$\gls{injective-function-f-A-B}$.
A \emph{surjective} function from $\setA$ onto $\setB$ is denoted
$\gls{surjective-function-f-A-B}$.
A \emph{bijective} function between $\setA$ and $\setB$ is denoted
$\gls{bijective-function-f-A-B}$.
A \emph{partial} function from $\setA$ to $\setB$ is denoted
$\gls{partial-function-f-A-B}$. If $\ff : \setA \pto \setB$ is a partial
function and $\ea \in \setA$, the notation $\gls{f-defined-a-b}$ means that
$\ff$ is defined at $\ea$ and its value is $\eb$;
the notation $\gls{f-undefined-a}$ means that $\ff$ is not defined at $\ea$.
