% Bounds

A function $\ff : \Nats \to \Nats$ is \emph{polynomially bounded} if there is a
polynomial $\polyp$ and a number $\nn_0 \in \Nats$ such
that $\ff(\nn) \leq \polyp(\nn)$ for all $\nn \geq \nn_0$.
The function $\ff$ is \emph{exponentially bounded} if there is a polynomial
$\polyp$ and a number $\nn_0 \in \Nats$ such that
$\ff(\nn) \leq 2^{\polyp(\nn)}$ for all $\nn \geq \nn_0$.
%The function $\ff$ is \emph{exponentially larger} if there is a polynomial
%$\polyp$ (with real coefficients) and a number $\nn_0 \in \Nats$ such that
%$\ff(\nn) \geq 2^{\polyp(\nn)}$ for all $\nn \geq \nn_0$.
We are going to use these terms implicitly with respect to quantities that
depend on one another. For example, the cardinality of $\Perms\nn$ is
exponentially bounded by $\nn$.
