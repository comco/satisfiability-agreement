% Alphabets

An \emph{alphabet} $\gls{alphabet-O}$ is just a nonempty set.
A \emph{word} $\gls{word-w}$ over $\alphO$ is a finite sequence with elements
from $\alphO$. The set of words over $\alphO$ is $\gls{words-O}$.
The set of nonempty words over $\alphO$ is $\gls{nonempty-words-O} =
\Words\alphO \sub \set{\eword}$.
If $\nn \in \Nats$, the set of words of length $\nn$ over $\alphO$ is
$\gls{words-O-n}$.
By abuse of notation, we identify the set of words of length $n$ over
$\alphO$ with the $n$-ary cartesian power: $\alphO^n =
\underbrace{\alphO\cprod\alphO\cprod\dots\cprod\alphO}_{n}$.
