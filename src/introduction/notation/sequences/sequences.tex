% Sequences

A \emph{sequence} is formally just a function with domain an ordinal number.
If $\seqA$ is a sequence, its \emph{length} $\gls{length-A}$ is just the domain
of $\seqA$.
An \emph{element} of a sequence is an element from its range.
The sequence consisting of the elements $\ea$, $\eb$ and $\ec$ in that order is
$\gls{sequence-of-a-b-c}$, or alternatively written using a word notation $abc$.
The \emph{empty sequence} is \gls{empty-seq}.
A \emph{finite sequence} is a sequence of finite length.
If $\seqA$ and $\seqB$ are two sequences, their \emph{concatenation}
is $\gls{concatenation-A-B}$, and the sequence obtained from $\seqA$ by
dropping all elements of $\seqB$ is $\gls{without-A-B}$.
